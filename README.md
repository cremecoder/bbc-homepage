# BBC homepage recreation - Frontend project

This repo contains the development files for my recreation of the **BBC Homepage** using just **HTML, CSS with SCSS and a bit of javascript**.

### Why did I choose to do this project?

I wanted to showcase my ability to code a **frontend without the use of frameworks**. I chose the BBC homepage because of its unique navigation 
bar and interesting card layout for it's featured news articles. Because the BBC homepage has many repeating features (such as the card 
layouts) I included only one or two examples of each card section.

### Features - development files

- src/index.html: Main and only output file. 
- src/assets: Contains svg files as a reference to the inline ones used in **index.html**.
- src/scss: All scss files.
<br>
<br>
### Features - finished product

- Fully responsive and fluid layout. 
- Inline SVG's for all icons for quality on all screen sizes.
- Optimised images for browsers by using 'srcset' and 'sizes' attributes on <img> tags.
- To avoid any [copyright issues with the BBC] I used a different font face than [BBC Reith].
