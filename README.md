### BBC homepage recreation - Frontend project

This repo contains the development files for my recreation of the BBC Homepage using just HTML, CSS with SCSS and a bit of javascript.


### Why did I choose to do this project?

I wanted to showcase my ability to code a frontend without the use of frameworks. I chose the BBC homepage because of its unique navigation 
bar and interesting card layout for it's featured news articles.
